= OpenShift 3 demo Vagant environment
This repository will help you creating some virtual machines to follow the https://github.com/openshift/training/blob/master/beta-4-setup.md[Openshift v3 beta4 training].


== Pre requisites
You'll need the RHEL 7.1 vagrant box (base image). You should import it into your vagrant boxes with name *rhel-7.1*

This guide will work with VirtualBox and Libvirt providers, so you'll need the appropriate box, depending on the provider you want to use.

This configuration requires the following Vagrant plugins:

* https://github.com/smdahlen/vagrant-hostmanager[vagrant-hostmanager >= 1.5.0]
* https://rubygems.org/gems/vagrant-registration[vagrant-registration >= 0.0.11]
* vagrant-libvirt (If using libvirt installation)


== The setup
This Vagrant file will setup 4 nodes, and will install OpenShift v3 on top, if you have the appropriate subscriptions to do so :-D

The nodes that will create are:

* *ose3-helper (ose3-helper.example.com)*: This box will hold all of your external stuff, not really part of OpenShift. It will install dnsmasq, and will serve as the DNS server that you would have in a real environment. 
* *ose3-master (ose3-master.example.com)*: Openshift Master and Node. As a node, it will hold infra type of services (registry, routers, etc...)
* *ose3-node1  (ose3-node1.example.com)*: Openshift Node. Application targeted node.
* *ose3-node2  (ose3-node2.example.com)*: Openshift Node. Application targeted node.

== Configruation
You'll need to register your nodes in subscription manager, so some properties are externalized in order to get your credentials. You'll need to add these ENV variables to your system:

* *ACCESS_USERNAME*: Username for access.redhat.com
* *ACCESS_PASSWORD*: password for access.redhat.com
* *POOL_ID*:  PoolID for subscription-manager to get the appropriate subscriptions for the system

== IPs
If you have vagrant-hostmanager plugin it will configure the IPs for you, otherwise, this are the internal IPs used for the setup.

## vagrant-hostmanager-start id: 2af06922-6862-46b1-9ad3-29269ad41896
192.168.133.100   ose3-helper ose3-helper.example.com
192.168.133.3  ose3-node1 ose3-node1.example.com
192.168.133.4  ose3-node2 ose3-node2.example.com
192.168.133.2  ose3-master ose3-master.example.com
## vagrant-hostmanager-end
----

== How to run
As the master will provision all the nodes, and the dns is required for everything to work, the correct order for initial setup and provision of nodes is:

----
vagrant up ose3-helper
vagrant up ose3-node1
vagrant up ose3-node2
vagrant up ose3-master
----

Once you have ionstalled everything, you can just vagrant up everything.

----
vagrant up
----

When starting the nodes with vagrant, the nodes will be registered in susbcription-manager, and will be removed from subscription-manager if you destroy the boxes through Vagrant using the vagrant-registration plugin.

----
vagrant destroy
